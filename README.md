<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<h3>"Professional" Indie Developer</h3>
Since Mid 2022 I've been developing my own games, It's been my passion, Its something I've found joy and love doing. From Design, to Code, to Models, to Textures, I love it all, even if I'm not to swell at some of the steps.
<h3>Cyber Security/Ethical Hacking</h3>
Since Late 2024 I've had a sudden and vast interest in Cyber Security after the Airforce and Army suggested I enlist and do it for them since I had a background in code. While I'm not great at either as of November 2024, I intend to increase my skill set in these realms, and possibly even pursue a career in Cyber Security.
<h3>General Programming</h3>
From getting bored and making a discord bot, to making programs that do the most random things for me so I can save seconds of my life that I'm wasting with energy drinks. Programming is life, programming is love; solving problems, logical thinking, knowing and using all sorts of functions, APIs, formulas, theories, math that sometimes flies over my head, and trusting random people on stack overflow and realizing that I shouldn't have done that once I actually understand the subject? Its amazing, and I can never imagine myself getting bored of doing it.
